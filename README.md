Guess the letter the computer is thinking!

The computer is thinking of a letter... see if you can guess it! Press any letter on the keyboard to guess it. If you get it right, your win score increases, you don't lose a guess, and the computer picks a new letter! If you guess wrong, you lose one of your 9 guesses. When you reach 0 remaining guesses, it's game over!

This game uses basic browser API onkeyup event functions, tallies and updates your scores, and keeps track of any previous guesses as well as your remaining guesses!

Enjoy!
